So I would go and get a house or an apartment in a place for anywhere from one to six months, and enjoy what it feels like to actually live somewhere. And that to me is so exciting, you know. Although the sights and everything are cool, and hanging out with tourists can be fun, I much prefer to go down to the local caf\u00e9, open up my laptop, talk to the people that are working there, and really get a sense for what it\u2019s like to live in a city. \nAnd over the course of my career what that\u2019s looked like is you really develop a deep connection with the places that you live in.

And we\u2019re going to meet entrepreneurs from all around the world and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to Bali because Bali is the place that everybody wants to go.
