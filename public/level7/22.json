It's not called the dole though, it's called welfare, and basically what happens is if you lose your job, you can get money from the government, but it's really short-term. I think it's only six months or a year, but the biggest difference I think between Europe and America is the word. We call it welfare. And welfare is really negative. If you tell somebody that you're on welfare, or even on unemployment, then people really look at you negatively. \nWell, actually let me clarify. There's two: There's welfare which is kind of more long-term like if you have children, and then there's unemployment which is money you get from the government if you don't have a job. If you're on unemployment, it's not as bad but people still kind of look at you like you're", "type": 0}}, {"hive_text_custom": {"text": "a loser", "type": 2}}, {"hive_text_custom": {"text": ".
