One is it just takes too long for people to talk about a controversial topic, so for example if you really want to get into controversy, you know, it leads to long conversation and people expressing their view and arguing and the way that the audio is set up on elllo, it's kind of short. I try to keep it under three minutes, so that's one reason. But actually the main reason is because, you know, when people come in, I don't know them a lot of the times I don't know the speakers very well and so they're not really comfortable arguing with me or arguing with somebody else they don't know about something that's controversial, so we tend to not do that.", "type": 0}}, {"hive_text_custom": {"text": "Greg:", "type": 1}}, {"hive_text_custom": {"text": "OK, alright,", "type": 0}}, {"hive_text_custom": {"text": "it's something you might want to think about", "type": 0}}, {"hive_text_custom": {"text": ".
